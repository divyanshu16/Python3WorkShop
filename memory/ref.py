    Generational garbage collector : circular references

    The reference counting module is fundamental to Python and can't be disabled,
    whereas the cyclic GC is optional and can be used manually.

    In order to decide when to run, each generation has an individual counter and threshold.
    The counter stores the number of object allocations minus deallocations since the last collection.
    Every time you allocate a new container object, CPython checks whenever the counter of the first generation
    exceeds the threshold value.
    If so Python initiates the —Åollection process.
